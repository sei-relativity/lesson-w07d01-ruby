 Ruby is made by japanese guy "Mat" 1995

 *could change the Ruby language .
 *ruby on rails 

rubygems is like npm it is for developer.it allowed developer to install liberties and packages 

packages we install  

1- gem install pry ; gem install pry-doc //need it for backend debugging and console 
    - pry //run pry using pry on CML
    - pry powerful command tools 
    - use ? to get DOC of tools 
    -ls will show obj
    -cd String will take you to String obj that can use ls to show all methodes 
    -gets is methods to get input from user 
        -   gets.chomp gets input without "/n"
    -gets.chomp.to_i
2- # is used for commant 
3- ruby can be convert to js and run in front-end
4-Developer Experience (DX) 
5-Ruby is used to make developer happy but twitter swich to other language for performance 
6- can not use combine integer  and string ex "foo" +4 error
    -to fix it "foo" +4.to_s 
    -   num=42
        puts "i am #{num.to_s} years" 

    - scape character  \" ex  puts "i am \" #{num.to_s} years" 

7- === is semantic diff than js "dont use === for check statement  "
8 every thing is true expats nil and false 
9. nil.nil?  ==> if (nil ==nil) return true 
10-single line if statement
    -age=9000
    -puts "you'r very old!" if age>=100
    -puts 'you are old!' unless age < 100
11- even/old is methods return true of false
    -num.even ?"#{num} is even:"#{num} is odd" //use pry is console  
12-string methodes there are methods do not change origin it return a new string 
    EX A= "aaaa"
    a.upcase //return a new string and do 
    a.upcase! //return chaged "a" string 

    مهم 
    a="aaa"
    b=a // b will take the address of "a" .any change on b will change "a". 

13- "".methods.sort ==>to list all the methods
14
        # switch statment
    num_of_wheels = 1
    case num_of_wheels
    when 1
        puts 'Unicycle'
    when 2
        puts 'Bicycle'
    when 3
        puts 'Tricycle'
    when 4
        puts 'Car'
    else
        puts 'What the hell are you riding?'
    end
    person_name = 'Hamza'
    case person_name
    when 'Hisham'then puts 'Your hero'
    when 'Hazim'then puts 'Who Dis?'
    else 
        puts 'Not important enough'
    end
    Collapse

15-:word_word ==> make const string "word word "
16- object_id  "obaid".object_id ==> will get new address everytime.Also :obaid.object_id ==> will give you same id every time since it is const 
17- use to_sym to convert string to const "obaid".to_sym.return to string use "obaid".to_sym.so_s
18-first ,last both methodes use to get first last in array
    ex ["aa","bb","r"].first ==> #"aa"
     ex ["aa","bb","r"].first(2) ==> #["aa","bb"]
19- add two array using (+)  [1,2,3]+[4]==>[1,2,3,4]
    subtract element from array [1,2,4,5]-[5]==>[1,2,3,4]
    multiply array [1]*3==>[1,1,1]
20- hash is called in object in javascript 
21-delete(value) method delete all the element in array equals to it ,delet_at (index)==>del only elm with the index

22-key in hash can be either string or key
 

23- p is shortcut of puts

24= key of hash use symbol ":" close to the key without space  test:"ss"   not test :"ss"
25- old way to declare hash key "techier" => 33 instead of techer: 33 
26-if the hash key is symble than use ":" to get value .if  kay string than you dont need ":"
27- => call it hash racket 
28- keys is methods used to list all the key of hash .
29- p sei[:blue][:oh]  ===> take the key hash which is in sei hash than take key inside the key hash :blue


30- shovel operator << is good methods can used in array to add in element to the array as push method
	ex [1,2,3,4]<<4 ==>[1,2,3,4,4] 
	ex [1,2,3,4]<<[1,2] ==>[1,2,3,4,[1,2]]

31-snake_case  name of vaariable is small and use "_" and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE something but it must be capital 

32-Anonymous functions in js is ()=>{}

33- do end is like  {} .Also using {} can wite single line of code.Otherhand do end can not work in a single line 
34- call function  with parameters in js and you do not pass the parameters it will run .In ruby method if call a method without parameters the method need will not work 
35- ruby methodes return the last line  if methodes does not return something 
36- ? is called Predicate Methods in ruby 
37-
    By prepending & to a symbol you are creating a lambda function that will call method with a name of that symbol on the object you pass into this function. Taking that into account:

    ar.map(&:reverse)
    is roughly equivalent to:

    ar.map { |element| element.reverse }

38- pipe |num| is parameters that black take in ruby
